This is my first tumblr theme. Very simple, because I lack the ability to make
it more complex. It focuses on the content rather than the social stuff. The
theme does NOT display notes/reblogs/likes in any form whatsoever. It has NO
support for Twitter/Disquis and other widgets. I'm currently using this theme
on a tumblelog composed by text posts only, with the number of posts per page
set to 1.
